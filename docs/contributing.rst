Contributions to the ``spines`` package are welcome and credit will be given
for any contributions via the ``AUTHORS.md`` file.  There are a few things to
note when making contributions:

- This project uses numpy-style docstrings and all code must be thoroughly
  documented in order for it to be accepted.  For more information on the
  docstring format see the
  `numpydoc docstring guide <https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ and
  numpy docstring `examples <https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_numpy.html>`_.

- This project follows the PEP8 standards for code style and all new code must
  follow the same conventions.

First fork the repository to create a copy to make your changes on.  Once
you've finished your contribution you will need to ensure that the project's
unit tests all pass and that the code passes flake8 and coverage tests.

Once you've ensured the code passes all tests you can then submit a pull
request on the project's
`github repository <https://www.github.com/douglasdaly/spines/>`_.
