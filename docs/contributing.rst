############

Contributions to the ``spines`` package are welcome and credit will be
given for any contributions via the ``AUTHORS.md`` file.


Requirements
============

There are a few things to note when making contributions:

- This project uses numpy-style docstrings and all code must be
  thoroughly documented in order for it to be accepted.  For more
  information on the docstring format see the `numpydoc docstring guide
  <https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ and numpy docstring
  `examples <https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_numpy.html>`_.

- This project follows the PEP8 standards for code style and all new
  code must follow the same conventions.  While we generally don't
  follow the strictest PEP8 standards it's generally used - please, if
  contributing, write clean, neat and organized code (or use something
  like ``black`` or ``autopep8``).  Remember, **code is read far more
  than it is written**, so please take the time to ensure your code is
  well written, well documented, and easy to read.

- Please conduct yourself in a polite and respectful manner, in
  accordance with the project's :doc:`code of conduct <conduct>`.  As a
  general rule-of-thumb: be nice and respectful to everyone.

- Please ensure that any and all contributions made to the project are
  yours and belong to you.  Do not violate any agreements or infringe
  upon the intellectual property of any other individual or organization
  that you may be bound to.  If your code utilizes some code from
  another project make sure to give credit where it's due (and/or as
  that project's license may require).

- This project is licensed under the MIT License (see
  :ref:`this page <license>` for details), all contributions which are
  accepted and included in the project will be subject to that license's
  terms.  Make sure any code incorporated from other projects or under
  other licenses is compatible with this project's license.


Process
=======

First, fork the repository to create a copy to make your changes on.
Once you've finished your contribution you will need to ensure that the
project's unit tests all pass and that the code passes flake8 and
coverage tests. Once you've ensured the code passes all tests you can
then submit a pull request on the project's
`github repository <https://www.github.com/douglasdaly/spines/>`_.

For more detailed information on this process and on the tools already
built into this project specifically for development see
:doc:`the development section <development.index>` for that.
